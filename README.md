## Verve Frontend Test

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Will use state management library in future work.

Carousel I would use in production: [https://uiinitiative.com/catalog/carousel-slider]

Live: [https://verve-one.vercel.app/]

Far from perfect, but I think you get the point.
